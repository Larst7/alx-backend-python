0x00-python_variable_annotations
Overview
This project focuses on Python variable annotations, a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows developers to add type hints to variables, function parameters, and return values. These annotations improve code readability, enable better static analysis, and help with debugging and maintaining code.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

Understand the purpose and benefits of variable annotations.
Learn how to annotate variables with types.
Gain proficiency in annotating function parameters and return types.
Use type hints to improve code quality and maintainability.
Project Structure
The project is divided into the following tasks:

Basic Annotations: Introduce basic variable annotations.
Function Annotations: Annotate function parameters and return values.
Complex Types: Work with complex data types like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
Type Aliases: Use type aliases to simplify annotations.
Callable and Union Types: Explore callable types and union types.
Advanced Annotations: Delve into more advanced annotation techniques.

Files
0-basic_annotations.py: Contains basic variable annotations.
1-function_annotations.py: Demonstrates function parameter and return type annotations.
2-complex_types.py: Examples of annotating complex data types.
3-type_aliases.py: Shows how to create and use type aliases.
4-callable_union.py: Explains callable and union types.
5-advanced_annotations.py: Covers advanced annotation techniques.
Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
Usage
To run the scripts and see the annotations in action, simply execute the Python files using the Python interpreter:

bash
Copy code
python3 0-basic_annotations.py
python3 1-function_annotations.py
# and so on...
Example
Here is a basic example of variable and function annotations:

python
Copy code
# Variable annotation
age: int = 25

# Function annotation
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
